== 1.1.1
* Using bundler to package what gems we can. Not sure yet how to bundle ffi,
  since we need a platform-specific gem.

== 1.1.0
* Conversion from native extension to FFI
* Upgraded diy, constructor, and hardmock to their latest versions
* Internal implementation changes. minilab's public interface is unchanged
* Integration tests removed, as the value they provide did not outweigh the maintenance burden

== 1.0.0
First release
